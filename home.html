             population</h1>
        <div class="left-text"><p>Out of the seven living sea turtle species 
            recorded in the world, Sri Lanka is blessed to have five species
             reported along the beautiful coastal belt of the island - coming
              for nesting.The Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas), Olive Ridley 
              (Lepidochelys olivacea), Hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), 
              Loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and Leatherback (Dermochelys 
              coriacea) make the big five.</p>

        <div class="right-text"><p>So if you plan a beach holiday in Sri Lanka,
            with the right experts like Mahoora Tented Camps Sri Lanka, 
            you are more than likely bound to see a few!Now, If we look at 
            these turtles separately:The Green Turtle is the most common in
            Sri Lankan waters. Growing to a maximum length of 1m and 
            weighing about 250kg, an adult female can lay between 120 to 40
            eggs at a time.</p></div>

        <h1>CORAL REEFS</h1>
        <div class="secotext">
        <p>Coral reefs are home to Hawksbills, which specialise 
        in eating a handful of species of sea sponges. This diet 
        allows less common types of sponges to grow, which increases 
        the variety of life on the reef. Without Hawksbills, sponges 
        can overgrow and suffocate slow-growing corals causing them to
        die. As reefs become more and more threatened by climate 
        change and other detrimental challenges, the role of the 
        Hawksbill on the reef has become even more crucial.</p></div>

        <h1>BEACHES</h1>
        <div class="secttext">
        <p>Sea turtles also have a positive influence on water. 
            Nesting sea turtles help beaches by depositing their eggs 
            in the sand. Eggshells and unhatched eggs left behind provide 
            important nutrients that nourish dune vegetation such as beach
            grasses, which stabilise dunes and help to prevent coastal 
            erosion.</p></div>

            <h1>TURTLE PREY</h1>
            <div class="thirdtext">
                <p>Different species of sea turtles feed on different 
                    things, though most of them like jellyfish. Leatherback
                     sea turtles specialise in eating jellyfish which keeps 
                     the jellyfish population in check. If Leatherbacks were 
                     to disappear, jellyfish populations would 
                     explode - Turtle02causing an imbalance in marine
                      biodiversity. Jellyfish prey upon larval fish, 
                      so without these larval fish - there would be no 
                      fish in the sea! Again, stating how important the 
                      preservation of marine life is so vital to maintaining 
                      that fine balance.</p></div>

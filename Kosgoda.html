  <section class="SECTION2">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Today, six out of the seven species of sea turtles are endangered. 
      And most of it is because of human exploitation of natural resources. 
      Thankfully, this hatchery has taken the onus to protect them. They start 
      with keeping an eye on the nesting mother turtles, bringing their eggs to 
      the secure environment of the hatchery and finally releasing the baby 
      turtles into the sea on the day of their birth. However, if there are 
      complications, they tend to them and release them only once theyâ€™re fit 
      to go into the vast ocean.
      Kosgoda is the one of the very few hatcheries where all the five species 
      in the country make their nests. They are the Olive Ridleys, Leatherbacks, 
      Green Turtles, Loggerheads and Hawksbills.

    <h1>Conservation Efforts</h1>
    <p>
      One of the primary activities 
      of the hatchery is locating and protecting sea turtle nests. 
      The staff and volunteers carefully monitor the nesting beaches, 
      identify turtle nests, and relocate them to safer areas within the 
      hatchery. This practice helps to prevent predation, disturbance, and 
      erosion of nests caused by natural elements.

      Hatchery Facilities: The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery maintains 
      a well-equipped facility where rescued or relocated sea turtle eggs are 
      incubated in a controlled environment. The temperature and humidity 
      conditions are monitored to mimic the natural nest conditions, ensuring 
      a high hatching success rate.

    <h1>Turtle Species</h1>
    <p class="p1">
      Sri Lanka is blessed with an abundance of natural beauty, and its 
      coastal waters are home to several remarkable turtle species. These 
      magnificent creatures have been an integral part of Sri Lanka's marine 
      ecosystem for millions of years. The country's tropical climate and 
      diverse coastal habitats provide a favorable environment for turtles to 
      thrive.
      Sea turtles are a cherished symbol of Sri Lanka's rich biodiversity 
      and play a vital role in maintaining the health of marine ecosystems. 
      Sri Lanka is known for being a significant nesting site for several 
      endangered and critically endangered turtle species. The conservation 
      efforts in the country focus on protecting these turtles throughout 
      their life cycle, from nesting to hatching and their subsequent return 
      to the ocean.
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
      Among the turtle species found in Sri Lanka, the Olive Ridley turtle 
      is the most abundant. These small turtles, with their olive-green 
      shells, can be found nesting along the country's east coast. The Green 
      turtle, known for its vibrant green fat and large size, is another 
      notable species that nests primarily along the southern coast of Sri 
      Lanka. The Loggerhead turtle, distinguished by its robust head, is also 
      found in Sri Lankan waters, although its nesting activities are 
      relatively less common.

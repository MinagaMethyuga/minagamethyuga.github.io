                <h1>FISHERIES BYCATCH</h1>
                <p>Itâ€™s estimated that the fishing industry contributes to the
                death of thousands to tens of thousands of sea turtles each 
                year. Turtles that become trapped in longlines, gill nets and 
                trawls are thrown away as bycatch. And those that manage to 
                avoid fishing nets are impacted by the disruption to their 
                food supply and habitat.</p>

                can have a positive or negative impact on sea turtles and other

            <p>Teach your friends and family about the impact of their seafood

             businesses to teach the rest of your community about eating 
             sustainably caught seafood in your area. Talk to restaurant staff,
              grocery store managers, and other members of your community about 
              the importance of sustainable seafood choices.</p>

                <h1>COASTAL DEVELOPMENT</h1>
                <p>Every year, sea turtle habitats are destroyed because of 
                shrinking coastlines. Wherever there is boat vessel traffic, 
                whenever a new hotel or high-rise is built up along the shore,
                and wherever there is sea floor dredging and beach erosion sea
                turtle food supplies and nesting areas take a major hit.</p>

            vacation, choose to stay at a hotel or resort that is working to 
            protect its surrounding environment. If traveling to a sea turtle 
            nesting area, confirm that the establishment has taken the steps 
            necessary to ensure the safety of nesting females, nests, and 
            hatchlings. Do they turn lights off in the evening? Instruct guests
             on proper observation behavior? Support or partner with a beach 
             monitoring program? If not, tell them to; if so, let them know 
             how much you appreciate it.</p>

                <h1>DIRECT TAKE</h1>
                <p>Throughout the world, turtles are killed and traded on the 
                global market as exotic food, oil, leather, and jewelry. Over 
                the past 100 years, millions of hawkbill turtles alone have 
                been killed just for the price of their shells. And even though
                today the global trade of luxury and craft items has reduced 
                thanks to conservation efforts, it still remains an ongoing 
                threat to turtles in parts of Africa, Asia and the Americas.</p>

            both for sustenance and for profit, both legally and illegally. 
            International trade in turtle products is illegal and also a major
            threat to sea turtles, hawksbills in particular. All of us can help

                <h1>CLIMATE CHANGE</h1>
                <p>We are just now learning the extent to which climate change
                can affect sea turtles. Climate change can impact the natural
                sex ratios of hatchlings, increase the likelihood of disease
                outbreaks, and can escalate the frequency of extreme weather
                events, which destroy nesting beaches and coral reefs.</p>

            <div class="solusecthreats"><p>Although we may not yet fully 
            understand the far-reaching effects of climate change, we 
            understand enough to know that addressing it is among the most 
            pressing challenges of our time. Sea turtle habitats such as 
            nesting beaches and coral reefs have already been affected by 
            rising sea levels and temperatures, but we can help avoid further 
            damage by acting to mitigate climate change now.</p>
